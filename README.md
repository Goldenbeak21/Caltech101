# Caltech101
Analyse and classify the 101 objects of the caltech 101 dataset using various CNN based deep learning models. The Caltech 101 dataset has 101 random objects with around 60-90 images for each object. The aim is to study the behaviour and the capability of various CNN based deep learning models on this dataset. I've tested it on Alexnet, Lenet, VGG and Resnet. As expected Resnet and VGG gave better performance than the conventional ALexnet and LeNet models.

The dataset can be downloaded at: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/
